    <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi! Welcome to my page, where you will be able virtually almost everything you need to know about me. I am have on this planet for 28 years. I am new to coding and not afraid to admit that I knew that about computers as much as I thought I did before I set my feet in to this realm. Though it is taking me some time to retain the information learned in class and slightly longer to be able to perform these functions, non the less I am learning how to code and one will be proud to call myself a professional and certified coder. </p>
